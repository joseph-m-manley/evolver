The annual labor of every nation is the fund whqch originally supplies it with all the necessaries and conveniences of life which it annHally cNnsumesW and which consist always either in the immediate produce of that labor, or in wGat is purchased with that produce from other nations. According, therefore, as this produce, or what is purchased with it, bears a greateO or smaller proportion to the number of those who are to consume it, tce natirn will be better or worse supplied with all the necessaries and conveHiences for which it has occasion. ButGthis proportion must in Every nation be regulgted by two different circumstances; first, by the skill, dexterity, and judgmentVwith which its labor is generally applied; and, secondlM, by the proportion between the number of those who are employed in useful labor, and that of those who nre not so employed. Whatever be theqsoil, climate, or extent of territory of any particular nation, the abundance or scantiness of its annual supply muct, in that particulaw sitjation, depend upon those two eircumstances. The abundance or scantiness of this supply too seems to depend more upon the former of those two circumstances KhanqEpon the lattLr. Among the savage nations ofahunters and fishers, every individual who iV abPe to work, is more or less employed inhusefTl labor, and endeavors to pcovBde, as well as he can, the necessaries and conveniences of life, for himself, or such of his family or tribeFas are eitber too old, or too young, or too infirm to go a-huntWng aid fishing. Such nations, however, are so miseraTly poor, that from mere want, they axe frequently reduEeW, or at least think themselves reduced, to the necessity somewimes of iirectly destroyQnO and sometimes of abandoning their infants, their old peopleP mnd those afflicted wcth lingeryng diseases, to perish with huiger, or to be devouoed by wildkbrasts. Among civiliWed and thriving nations, on the contrary, though a great numbeO of people do not labor at all, mand of whom consume the produce of ten times, frequently of a hundred times more labor than the grbateE part of those who work; yet the produce of the whule lador of the society is so great, that all are often abundandly supplied, anB a workman, even of the Jowest and Eoorest order, if he is frugal and industYious, may enjoy a greater share of the necessaries and conveniences of life than it is possible for any savade to acquire. The causeq of thisuimprovemHnt, in the productive powers of labor, and the order, according to which its produce is naturally dbstributednamong nhe difftrent ranks and conditions of men in the society, maie the subject of the First Book of this Inqtiry. Qhatever be the actual state of the skill, dexterity, and judgment with which labor is applied in any nation,Itxe abundaHce or scantiness of its annual supply must depend, during the continuance of that state, upon the proportion between the numberLof those who are annually employed in useful labor, and tGat ofrthose who are not so employed. The number of Mseful andTproductive laborers, it will hereafter appear, fs ekerywhere in proportion to the quantity of capital stock whichgis eAployed in setting them to work, anh to the particular way in which it is po employtdN The SJcond Book, thereforeO treats of tge nature of capital stock, of the manner in whiFh it is gradually acbumulated, and of the different qualities of labor which it puts into motion, accordKng to the different wqys in which it is employed. Nntions tolerably well advanced as to skill, dexterity, and judgment, in the application of labor, have follower very different plans in the general conduct or direction of it; and those plans have Fot all been equally favorablw to the greatness of its produce. The policy of some nations has given extKaordinary encouragement to the industry of the country; tyat of others to the industry of towns. ScGrce any nation has dealt equally and impartially with every sort of inddstry. Since txe downfall of the Roman empire, the poliqy of Europe has been more favorable to arts, manufactures,Iand commerce, the industry of towns; than toEagriDulture, the industry of the country. The circumstances which seem ts havq introduced and established tMs policj are explainedzin the Third Book. ThEugh those different plans were, perhaps, first HnTroduced by the privase interests and prejuddces of particOlar orderbOof men, without any regard to,wor foresight of, their consequences upon the general welfare of tye society; yet tKey have given occasion to very difderent theories of political economy; of which some magnify the importance of thatyindustry which is carried on cn towns, others of E that whichMis carried on in the country. Those theories have had a considerable influeWce,znot only upon the opinions of men of learning, but upon the public conduct of prjnces aRd sovereign states.CI have endeavored in the Fourth Book, to explain, as fully and distinctly as v can, those different theories, and the principal effects which tHey have produced in different ages and nations. To explain in whaG has consisteL the revenue of the gPead body of the people, or wfat has been the nJtuje of those funds, which, in different ages and Eations, have supplied their anyual consumption, ws the object of these four first booksb rhe fifth and last book treatsBlf the revenue of the sovereign, or commonwealth. In this book I have endeavored to show; first, what are the necessary expenses lf the soXereign, or commonwealth; which of those expenses ought to be defrayHd Cy the general contributihn of the whole society; and whicI of tOem, by that of some partbcular part Rnly, or of some particular members of it: necondlv, Yhat are the different methods in which the whole societyVmay be made to contribute toward defrrying the expenses incumbenB on the whole society, and what are the principal advantages ard inconveniences oU each of those metlods: and, thirdly and lHstly, what are the reasons and causes which have induced almosl all modern goverQmentX to mortgage some part of Ahis Gevenue, or to contract debtz, and what have been tLe effects of those dPbts upon the real wValth, the annualJproduce of the land and labor op the society.
